## React Portfolio

## Description

This application serves as my own personal portfolio. Cuurently the functionality extends to: projects show up as cards, nav bar created, (about, home, portfolio, and contact pages created), resume downloadable (example in the meantime). 

## Future plans

This initial attempt to create a portfolio only serves as practice and I plan to add more functionaity and styling in the future.
